# Momentum based trading strategy considering arbitrary number of US Stocks compared to Buy and Hold
*__Marcell Kujbus, Financial Mathematician/Empirical Finance Researcher__*
This folder consists of an implementation of the famous Moving Average trading strategy on arbitrary number of US stocks. A grid search was applied to find the optimal SMA - LMA pair (which 
beats the Buy and Hold the most). Please open the Jupyter notebook (.ipynb), as it contains the description of the strategy and some limitations as well.
Use the original (.py) formatted code if you have some additional idea.
Object Orientated programming was used.
