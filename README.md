# Home codes' repository
*__Marcell Kujbus, Financial Mathematician/Empirical Finance Researcher__* <br>
This is a repository where I upload my codes. The codes were made for fun, the ones for work don't get uploaded here. The repository 
consists of R and Python codes. The Python codes were made in Jupyter Notebook and in Spyder. <br>
The majority of the codes here were made by me, but there are several ones which were made in collaboration. Thanks Krisztián Szemán for the contribution.
