# Home codes' repository
*__Marcell Kujbus, Financial Mathematician/Empirical Finance Researcher__*
This is a repository to where I upload my codes. The codes were made for fun, the ones for work don't get uploaded here. The repository 
consists of R and Python codes. The Python codes were made in Jupyter Notebook.
The majority of the codes here were made by me, but there are several ones wich were made in collaboration. Thanks Krisztián Szemán for the contribution.
