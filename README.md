# Own codes' repository
*__Marcell Kujbus, Financial Mathematician/Empirical Finance Researcher__*
This is a repository where I upload my own codes. The codes were made for fun, the ones for work don't get uploaded here. The repository 
consists of R and Python codes. The Python codes were made in Jupyter Notebook.
